# Bitwise Operations with GUI

This assignment asked to implement a simple bit calculator with a Graphical User Interface
(GUI). The calculator accepts as input two unsigned integers and based on the selected operation - bitwise
AND, OR, XOR - the result is computed (again as an unsigned integer). Moreover, the bits of the operands
might be shifted left or right by a user-specified number of bits before the selected operation. You can see explained
the details of the GUI design and the work flow in corresponding folder.
