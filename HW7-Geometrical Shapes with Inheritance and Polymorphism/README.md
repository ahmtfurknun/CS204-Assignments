### Geometrical Shapes with Inheritance and Polymorphism

This assignment aims to make you familiar with inheritance (multi-inheritance) and
polymorphism issues. You will deal with multi-inheritance through implementing, from scratch,
several small classes, some of which inherit a class that already inherited another class. The content
and a brief description of each the classes can be seen in corresponding folder.
