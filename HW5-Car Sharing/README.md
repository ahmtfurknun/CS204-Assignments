This assignment aims to practice on object sharing via reference variables. In this assignment, you are
asked to develop an IT system for a taxi company where two or more drivers share a taxi vehicle (car). In
your implementation you are going to write two classes, Car and Driver, such that two (or more)
driver objects share one car object via reference variables.
