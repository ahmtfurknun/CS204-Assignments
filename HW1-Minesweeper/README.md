# Minesweeper

This assignment is about developing a simplified version of the Minesweeper game. Minesweeper is a single-player 
puzzle video game. The objective of the game is to clear a rectangular board containing hidden "mines" or 
“bombs” without detonating any of them, with the help from clues about the number of mines in the neighboring
cells. The game originates from the 1960s, and it has been written for many computing platforms in use today.
It has many variations and offshoots. The aim of this assignments is to practice matrices (vectors of vectors).
Some versions of Minesweeper set up the board so that the solution does not require guessing. If a
square (cell) containing a mine is revealed (opened), the player loses the game. If no mine is revealed, a
digit is instead displayed in the square, indicating how many adjacent (neighboring) cells contain mines; if
no mines are adjacent, the square becomes blank, and all adjacent squares will be recursively revealed. The
player uses this information to deduce the contents of other squares and may either safely reveal each
square or mark the square as containing a mine.
