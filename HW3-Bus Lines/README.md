### Bus Route System 

This assignment is about to use a hybrid data structure consisted of singly linked lists and
doubly linked lists. It will be employed these structures to implement a bus line/stop
management system. Since the number of bus lines and stops cannot be known in advance
and changes from case to case, it will be used dynamic memory allocation, i.e., new/delete
operations to dynamically allocate and delete the corresponding nodes of the structures.
